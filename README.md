# hello-world
I am new to the programming world and I am here to educate myself.

Hello there, I am SoularTydes but you can just call me Soular for short. 
I am a Freshman in college and I will be majoring in Computer Science.
Over the past few months I have been wanting to try and teach myself about some of the programming languages.
While I was watching videos and reading I stumbled upon github and figured this would be an excellent place to learn!
